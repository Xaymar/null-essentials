= Installing NullEssentials on a Server =

== Prerequisites ==
NullEssentials requires the following things to work:
* CraftBukkit 1000 or higher
* Spout 1.0.1 or higher (not necessarily needed)
* A Text Editor to edit config.yml

== Installation ==
First download NullEssentials from the [http://code.google.com/p/null-essentials/downloads/list Downloads page] and put it in /plugins/ of your bukkit installation.
Run the server with the plugin once to generate the config.yml it should use. Close the server again and open up the config.yml, you should see this(taken from 0.2):
{{{
parts:
  #Should Slot Manager be enabled?(Reserved Slots, Joinmessage and -sound)
  slotmanager: true 

#Slot Manager Configuration
slotmanager:
  reserved:
    #How many slots should be reserved? (-1 equals all without the allowplayers limitation)
    count: -1
    #Should we allow normal players to join reserved slots?
    allowplayers: true
  join:
    #Template for customized Joinmessage and -sound:
    #Username:
    #  message: TextToDisplay
    #  sound: UrlToSound
    #When filled it looks along the lines of this:
    #Xaymar:
    #  message: 'This is a text.'
    #  sound: http://example.com/404.ogg
}}}
The config.yml is actually pretty self-descriptive but here's a walk-through to each Item:
  * parts - Group for Null Essentials, disable and enable each part of NullEssentials
  *  * (bool)slotmanager - Should Null Essentials enable Slot Manager?
  * slotmanager - Group for Slot Manager
  *  * reserved - Group for Reserved Slots
  *  *  * count - How many Slots should be reserved(-1 for all avaible, disables allowplayers)
  *  *  * allowplayers - Allow players without ne.slotmanager.reserved to join reserved slots?
  *  * join - Group for custom Joinmessage and -sound
  *  *  * (Username) - Who should have them? (This does not enable them)
  *  *  *  * message - Text to display after the user joined (leave empty to keep standard)
  *  *  *  * sound - URL to a sound file to play after the user joined (leave empty to disable)
